# Commonwealth Chronicle Site

A website for the school newspaper, containing front end and back end.

### Road map:
- Create back end to serve PDF
- Create authentication service on backend, to allow for uploading of articles. Include database to store username and password (doesn't need to be that many)
- Communicate with authentication service on frontend
- Create login page and UI to upload articles on front end
- Create working front end with list of PDF articles
- Create visually appealing front end rendering list of PDF articles + descriptions, anything that is contained in the uploading page


### Long term goals:
- Have uploading site include formatting, so it can render text on front end instead of having to deliver PDF
