# Commonwealth Chronicle Site

A website for the school newspaper, containing front end and back end.

### Road map:
- Create back end to serve PDF :white_check_mark:
- Connect front end to back end, allowing uploading of PDF to back end and saving
- Create authentication service on backend. Include database to store username and password (doesn't need to be that many), using SQL or Firebase or something of the like.
- Implement authentication on front end, and communicate with authentication service on back end
- Create login page and UI to upload articles on front end
- Create news page on front end with list of PDF articles that are uploaded
- Update front end to be visually appealing, rendering list of PDF articles + descriptions, anything that is contained in the uploading page + allowing rendering and downloading.


### Long term goals:
- Have uploading site include formatting, so it can render text on front end instead of having to deliver PDF.
